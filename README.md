## ⚠️ Important Rules

### 🧩 One Chance Only  
If you fail the interview, **no second attempt** will be given. Prepare well before attending.

### 🚫 No Mugging Up  
Don’t memorize code — you must **write and explain** the logic in your own words.  
We focus on **understanding**, not memorization.

### 💼 Corporate-Style Interview  
The interview format is similar to **corporate technical interviews**,  
but the **difficulty level** is **Easy to Medium** for 2nd-year students.

### 💻 Language Flexibility  
You can **code in any language** — Python, C, C++, Java, or JavaScript.  
What matters most is your **approach**, **clarity**, and **problem-solving skill**.

## 🎯 Objective
To assess your ability to think logically, implement efficient algorithms, and explain your reasoning — just like real-world software engineers do.

If you **crack our interview**, you’ll receive a **scholarship** 🏆.
